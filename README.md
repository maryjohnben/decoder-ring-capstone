# decoder-ring-capstone
###### project by Mary Benjamin
Project designed using complex JavaScript algorithms and the tests are done using Chai and Mocha.
Three functions are focused here and each does both encoding and decoding.
The functions are:
- caesar() - takes input and shift and returns encoded or decoded messages according to instructions.
- polybius() - takes in input and returns number pairs when encoded or message when decoded.
- substitution() - takes in input and alphabet and returns encoded or ded messages according to instructions

Project also has a working html/css portion. Feel free to check it out.
